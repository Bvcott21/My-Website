          <p class="p2">After many years between different programs and for different purposes, during my studies and my career itself, programming and a
            programmer logic as went to become the center of my professional and, even sometimes, the center of my life and knowledge.
             Also, my studies in Electronic engineering with specialization in Automation & Process Control allows me now not to only afront problems
              in terms of hardware, but to be also to understand the logic of programming in a correct manner in order to achieve the best results possible.</p>

          <h3>Problem solving</h3>
          <p class="p2">One thing that make us Engineers proud is our capability of problem solving and i'm not the exception. I'm always in a simultaneous process of learning and observation
            that allows me not only to learn very quick how processes work, but i'm constantly thinking how the could improve their performance or where and how could new processes improve and synchronize
            with all the existing ones. All this compelled with my ability to compromise with any project: doesn't matter how small or big the project, process or problem is, i'll always try to find
            a solution, to learn of it if its a new topic or field, and to sinthetize all the ideas into a whole concept to make everything work together.</p>
